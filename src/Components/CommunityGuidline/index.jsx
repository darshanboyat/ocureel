        <p>
          Zecue's mission is to inspire authenticity and genuine connection. We are
          committed to maintaining a supportive environment for our growing community.
          Our Community Guidelines establish a set of norms and common code of conduct
          that provide for a safe and welcoming space for everyone.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          At Zecue, we prioritize safety, diversity, inclusion, and authenticity. We
          encourage creators to celebrate what makes them unique and viewers to engage
          with what inspires them; we believe that a safe environment helps everyone
          do so openly. &nbsp;We prize the global nature of our community and strive
          to take into account the breadth of cultural norms where we operate. We also
          aim to cultivate an environment for genuine interactions by encouraging
          authentic content on Zecue.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Our Community Guidelines apply to everyone and everything on Zecue. We
          proactively enforce them using a mix of technology and human moderation and
          aim to do so before people report potentially violative content to us. We
          also encourage our community members to use the tools we provide on Zecue to
          report any content or account they believe violates our Community
          Guidelines.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          We will remove any content – including video, audio, livestream, images,
          comments, links, or other text – that violates our Community Guidelines.
          Individuals are notified of our decisions and can appeal them if they
          believe no violation has occurred. We will temporarily or permanently ban
          accounts and/or users that are involved in severe or repeated on-platform
          violations; we may also consider actions on other platforms and offline
          behavior in these decisions. Circumstances that involve any instance of a
          threat of real-world harm to human life that is specific, credible, and
          imminent may be reported to law enforcement authorities. The full Zecue
          experience is for people 16 and older, and we actively remove accounts of
          people we suspect are under this age.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Our algorithms are designed with trust and safety in mind. For some content,
          we may reduce discoverability, including by redirecting search results, or
          making videos ineligible for recommendation in the main feed. More
          information can be found below in the Ineligible for the feed section.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          At the same time, we recognize that some content that would normally be
          removed per our Community Guidelines may be in the public interest.
          Therefore, we may allow exceptions under certain limited circumstances, such
          as educational, documentary, scientific, artistic, or satirical content,
          content in fictional or professional settings, counterspeech, or content
          that otherwise enables individual expression on topics of social importance.
          To minimize the potentially negative impact of graphic content, we may first
          include safety measures such as an “opt-in” screen or warning.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          In consultation with relevant stakeholders, we update our Community
          Guidelines from time to time to evolve alongside new behaviors and risks, as
          part of our commitment to keeping Zecue a safe place for creativity and joy.

        <p>Minor safety</p>
        <p>
          We are deeply committed to protecting the safety of minors on our platform.
          Zecue defines a minor as any person under the age of 18. We prohibit
          activities that perpetuate the abuse, harm, endangerment, or exploitation of
          minors on Zecue. Any content, including animation or digitally created or
          manipulated media, that depicts abuse, exploitation, or endangerment of
          minors is a violation on our platform and will be removed when detected. We
          report child sexual abuse material (CSAM) and supporting evidence &nbsp;to
          the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children (NCMEC) and to any
          additional relevant legal authorities.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Our users must meet the minimum age requirements to use Zecue, as stipulated
          in our Terms of Service. When an underage account is identified, we remove
          it. Given our platform is designed with the safety of minors in mind, some
          of our features are age restricted. Account holders who are under the age of
          18 cannot receive referral payouts.
        </p>
        
        <h5>Sexual exploitation of minors</h5>
        <p>
          Zecue will take action on any content or accounts involving CSAM or sexual
          exploitation of a minor. Sexual exploitation of minors includes any abuse of
          a position of power or trust for sexual purposes, including profiting
          financially, socially, sexually, or politically from the exploitation of a
          minor. CSAM is defined as any visual depiction of sexually explicit nudity
          or conduct of a minor, whether captured by predatory adults, peers, or
          self-generated by minors.

              Grooming behaviors are those in which an adult builds an emotional
              relationship with a minor in order to gain the minor's trust for the
              purposes of future or ongoing sexual contact, sexual abuse, trafficking,
              or other exploitation. These behaviors may include: flattery, requests
              for contact on or off platform, requests for personal information,
              solicitation of minor sexual abuse material, sexual solicitations or
              comments, and gift-giving.

        <h5>Ineligible for the feed</h5>
        <p>
          The goal of the feed is to provide original content that honors our mission
          of inspiring authenticity and genuine connection. Each account holder’s feed
          is based on a personalized recommendation system. Our recommendation system
          is designed with user safety as a primary consideration, meaning that some
          content may not be eligible for recommendation. While the spontaneity of the
          feed is what makes Zecue unique, the feed is intended for a general audience
          that includes everyone from our teenage users to great grandparents. We
          consider the breadth of our audience when we determine what content is
          eligible for algorithmic promotion on the platform. Provided that it does
          not violate local laws, the following types of content may be allowed on our
          platform, searchable, and viewed in Following feeds but not eligible for
          recommendation.
        </p>
        
        <h5>Minor safety</h5>
        <p>
          Minors’ sense of judgment and identity mature as they develop. To provide
          teens with additional room for identity exploration and expression in
          digital spaces, content uploaded by users under the age of 16 is not
          eligible for recommendation. We strive to encourage healthy development
          across all ages. The promotion of cosmetic surgery to minors may lead to
          higher rates of body dissatisfaction. Accordingly, such content -- including
          before-and-after videos, videos of surgical procedures, and messages
          discussing elective cosmetic surgery without warning of risks -- are
          ineligible for the feed of all users under the age of 18.
        </p>
        
        <h5>Dangerous stunts and sports</h5>
        <p>
          Certain activities can be risky or dangerous when replicated without safety
          precautions, which could lead to physical harm. Content that includes
          dangerous stunts, or extreme sports performed by non-professionals, may be
          ineligible. (We remove content that depicts dangerous acts and challenges
          performed by non-professionals, which may lead to serious injury or death
          for the user or the public).
        </p>
        
        <h5>Overtly sexualized content</h5>
        <p>
          We are mindful that not all content may be suitable for all users
          (particularly our teenage users) and/or may be culturally inappropriate in
          certain regions. To help maintain a comfortable and age-appropriate
          experience, content that is overtly sexually suggestive may not be eligible
          for recommendation. This would include content that depicts implied nudity,
          sexualizes body parts, or is blatantly erotic or sensual (e.g., strip
          teases).
        </p>
        
        <h5>Tobacco and alcohol products</h5>
        <p>
          Zecue is deeply committed to protecting the safety of minors on our
          platform. Content promoting, mentioning, or depicting alcohol products
          consumed by persons of legal drinking age but done so in a dangerous fashion
          may not be eligible for recommendation. Content depicting the use of tobacco
          products by adults or mentioning controlled substances is not eligible for
          recommendation. Please remember that content which suggests, depicts,
          imitates, or promotes the possession or consumption of alcoholic beverages,
          tobacco, or drugs by a minor is prohibited. Content that offers instruction
          targeting minors on how to buy, sell, or trade alcohol, tobacco, or
          controlled substances is prohibited per our Community Guidelines as well.
        </p>
        
        <h5>Violent and graphic content</h5>
        <p>
          Our community celebrates creativity, but shock value isn't everyone's
          preference. Content that can cause discomfort, shock or disgust to viewers
          may be ineligible for the feed, including scary effects, jump scares, makeup
          that realistically replicates gory wounds, or depictions of bodily
          functions. Most violent and graphic content is not allowed on Zecue;
          however, in certain situations we may not remove some types of this content
          such as depictions of graphic deaths, accidents or fighting when real world
          events are being documented and it is in the public interest. Since this
          content isn't appropriate for all audiences, it will not be eligible for
          recommendation and the content will include an “opt-in” screen or warning.
        </p>
        
        <h5>Spam, inauthentic, or misleading content</h5>
        <p>
          We value authenticity and accuracy. We make ineligible for the feed any
          content that tricks or manipulates users in order to inauthentically
          increase followers, likes, views, or other engagement metrics on the
          platform, including follow-to-follow, like-to-like, and misleading or
          manipulating users into clicking like or share buttons. Conspiratorial
          content that counters generally accepted beliefs and casts blame on a group
          or entity (rather than any living individual) or that includes potentially
          misleading and harmful content about current, unfolding events where details
          are still developing, are also ineligible for recommendation.
        </p>
        
        <h5>Unoriginal, low-quality, and QR code content</h5>
        <p>
          Original and entertaining content form the core of the Zecue community. To
          maintain the positive experience our users expect from the Zecue platform,
          unoriginal and low-quality content is ineligible for recommendation. We
          consider content not original if it is imported or uploaded from Zecue,
          other platforms, or other sources including television, movies, or webcasts,
          and the user has not added new, creative edits. One indicator that the
          content is not original is a visible watermark or superimposed logo. Low
          quality content includes extremely short clips, static images, and
          exclusively-GIF based videos. Content that includes QR codes is usually
          ineligible for the feed because it can lead users to harmful websites or
          apps, though we make exceptions in certain circumstances where that risk is
          low (e.g., e-commerce).
        </p>
        
        <p>
          If you come across content or accounts that you believe may violate our
          Community Guidelines, please let us know &nbsp;so we can review and take
          appropriate action.
        </p>
