                <p>Last updated: July 2023</p>
                <p>
                    This Cookies Policy applies whenever you see our Platform. “Platform”
                    includes any services provided by Zecue with the exception of those
                    described in our separate Website Cookies Policy. Where we refer to “Zecue”,
                    “we” or “us” in this Cookies Policy, we mean Zecue LLC.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Like many websites and apps, our Platform uses cookies and other tracking
                    technologies such as software development kits (SDKs), pixels and local
                    storage. These technologies allow us to store information or gain access to
                    information stored on your device to enable certain features and distinguish
                    your device from others. Tracking technologies are used by most apps to
                    recognise that a device is the same as one used previously and to understand
                    some of its characteristics so that we can serve you advertising, measure
                    the performance of those ads, and to improve your experience. This policy
                    explains how we use these technologies, and the choices you have to control
                    them. Unless otherwise stated in this policy, our Privacy Policy applies to
                    the data we collect.
                </p>
                <h5>1. What technologies are used?</h5>
                <p>Our Platform uses the following kinds of technologies:</p>
                <p>
                    <b>Cookies:</b> &nbsp;Cookies are small text files that enable us and our service
                    providers and partners to uniquely identify your browser or device for
                    various purposes, including those described above. Cookies normally work by
                    assigning a unique number to your device and are stored on your browser by
                    the websites that you visit as well as third party service providers and
                    partners to those websites.&nbsp;
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cookies can remain on your computer or mobile device for different periods
                    of time. Some cookies are "session cookies", meaning that they exist only
                    while your browser is open and are deleted automatically once you close your
                    browser. Session cookies cannot be used to track your browser or device from
                    website to website.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Other cookies are "persistent cookies", meaning that they survive after your
                    browser is closed. Most persistent cookies are set to automatically expire
                    after a defined duration (for example, a few days, weeks or months). When
                    you return to that website (or visit other websites that use the same
                    cookies) the website provider or its service providers can recognise the
                    persistent cookies they have set and recognise your browsing device.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b> Local storage:</b>&nbsp;Local storage files are created by apps and websites to
                    store information locally on your device. They are very similar to cookies,
                    but can have slightly different properties (for example, local storage can
                    be used to store more information and can be stored in a different location
                    on your device to cookies). Local storage is normally used to speed up app
                    and site functionality and remember your preferences.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Application Programmable Interface (API):&nbsp;An API is a piece of software
                    which helps two or more applications to talk to one another. We use them to
                    communicate between Zecue and our service providers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Software Development Kits (SDKs):&nbsp;SDKs are pieces of code that enable
                    data to be collected about your device, network and interaction with a
                    website. Like cookies, they generally operate by assigning your device a
                    unique number.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b> Pixels:</b>&nbsp;Pixels are small 1 pixel x 1 pixel invisible image files that
                    are embedded in certain website pages. &nbsp;They can be used to collect
                    information about your visit to that website page. &nbsp;
                </p>
                <p>
                    When you open a website page with an embedded pixel, the page will
                    automatically run simple code that downloads the 1x1 image file to your
                    device. &nbsp;At the same time, the code also passes certain information
                    about your device and your actions on the website. Your interest in the
                    website can then be logged and used for analytics or advertising purposes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b> Mobile advertising IDs:</b>&nbsp;Your device has a unique number used by Zecue
                    and our service providers to recognise your device. Where you have provided
                    your consent, this allows personalized ads to be delivered to your device
                    and to measure the effectiveness of those ads.&nbsp;
                </p>
                <h5>2. Categories of tracking technologies</h5>
                <p>
                    The types of tracking technologies used by us and our partners in connection
                    with the provision of the Platform can be classified into the following
                    categories. Some of these categories are “essential” to provide you with the
                    services you have requested, such as to allow you to log into secure areas
                    of the Platform. The following is a list of of the categories of tracking
                    technologies we use:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b> Identification and security:</b>&nbsp;We recognise you when you return to our
                    Platform to make sure that you are the right user and to prevent activity
                    that violates our policies.&nbsp;
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, we check what country you are using the Zecue app from to
                    detect if someone may be trying to fraudulently access your account.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b> Content personalisation:</b>&nbsp;We use these technologies to ensure that we
                    can serve you with personalized content.&nbsp;
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, each User is given &nbsp;a unique Zecue ID number. We use this
                    to provide you with tailored content that will be of interest to you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Remembering your preferences:</b>&nbsp;We need to remember the settings you have
                    chosen on the Platform so that they work how you want them to.&nbsp;
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, we use these technologies in order to remember what languages
                    you want to see content in, the privacy settings you apply to your account
                    and/or videos and your Digital Wellbeing choices.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b> Functionality:</b>&nbsp;Functionality tracking technologies help to make the
                    Platform work more efficiently and to improve and optimize your experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, we determine which device you use, the software version and the
                    screen dimensions so that we can ensure the Zecue app functions correctly.
                    We also determine whether your battery is running low so that we can
                    optimize the Zecue app and we make sure that content loads and plays
                    correctly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b> Analytics:</b>&nbsp;We use analytics tracking technologies to analyze how you
                    use the Platform, including which pages you view most often, how you
                    interact with the content, measure any errors that occur and test different
                    design ideas. The information is used to report and evaluate your activities
                    and patterns as a user of the Platform.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, we may test new video creation features to help us decide which
                    features users prefer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Advertising and measurement:</b>&nbsp;Our Platform uses advertising and
                    measurement tracking technologies. These tracking technologies help us and
                    our advertisers show you relevant advertising and measure the performance of
                    ad campaigns. We also use these technologies to promote Zecue on the other
                    platforms and websites and measure their effectiveness.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, we will learn from our advertiser about whether you viewed
                    their products or bought something so we can learn how effective the ad was.
                    If you’ve already shown interest in an ad, we might show you it again, or we
                    might limit the number of times we show it to you.&nbsp;
                </p>
                <h5>3. Do other parties use these technologies on our Platform?</h5>
                <p>
                    Tracking technologies can either be “first-party” or “third-party”.
                    First-party tracking technologies refers to tracking technologies that we
                    set and use directly. Third-party tracking technologies refer to tracking
                    technologies set by third parties (such as our analytics or advertising
                    service providers).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our partners may use these technologies on our Platform to help us and our
                    advertisers understand how effective their ads are and to compare this to
                    their campaigns on other websites and apps.&nbsp;
                </p>
                <h5>4. How can I control these technologies?</h5>
                <p>You can control how these technologies are used:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <b> Personalized Ads in the Zecue app.</b>&nbsp;You are in full control of
                            whether Zecue serves you with personalized ads in the Zecue app. We do
                            not serve personalized ads without your consent. You can switch on
                            personalized ads by clicking on “Me” in the Zecue app, visiting the
                            settings page by pressing on the three dots in the top right corner,
                            then clicking on “Personalization and data” then using the toggle. You
                            can change this setting at any time.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <b> Advertising ID.</b>&nbsp;You can tailor your device settings to control your
                            advertising ID:
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                On Apple devices, you can enable the “Limit Ad Tracking” setting in your
                                device settings. &nbsp;
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                On Android devices, you can enable the “Opt out of Ads Personalization”
                                in your device settings.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>


                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <b>Partner opt-outs.</b>&nbsp;Many of the partners we work with also provide
                            opt-outs on their own websites. You can find details of this in their
                            own policies.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    As mentioned above, some uses of these technologies are essential for the
                    functioning of the Platform and so you cannot deactivate them.&nbsp;
                </p>
                <h5>5. Changes to this policy</h5>
                <p>

                    When we post changes to this policy, we will revise the "Last Updated" date
                    at the top of this policy. If we make any material changes in the way we
                    collect, use, and/or share information using these technologies, we will
