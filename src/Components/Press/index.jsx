            <p className='press__line'>Date: July 15, 2023</p>
            <p className='press__line'>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</p>

            <p className='press__line'>
                In a concerning turn of events, the up-and-coming social media app formerly known as ReelMe, now Ocureel, has been pushed to change its name once again due to alleged ownership claims by Instagram. The popular social media giant insists that any app with the term "reel" infringes upon their trademark, thereby pressuring Ocureel to rebrand. Despite receiving support from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), the financial burden of a legal battle has forced Ocureel to adopt a new name, Zecue, in hopes of escaping Instagram's grasp.

            <p className='press__line'>Ocureel emerged on the social media scene as a promising platform that sought to revolutionize user connections and interactions. However, Instagram's relentless pursuit to protect its branding interests has led to a distressing situation for the burgeoning app. The claims made by Instagram, asserting exclusive rights over the term "reel," have placed an unfair burden on Ocureel, pushing them into an unnecessary and costly rebranding process.
            </p>


            <p className='press__line'>The USPTO, acting as a neutral arbiter in intellectual property matters, sided with Ocureel by declaring that there was no likelihood of confusion between Ocureel and Instagram's Reels feature. This decision emphasized the uniqueness of Ocureel's brand and its distinct offerings within the social media landscape. Unfortunately, despite this favorable ruling, Ocureel lacks the financial means to engage in a prolonged legal battle against the industry behemoth that is Instagram.</p>

            <p className='press__line'>With their back against the wall, Ocureel has reluctantly rebranded as Zecue, hoping that this fresh identity will deter further unwarranted interference from Instagram. Zecue, a completely new concept, aims to provide users with a unique social media experience that enables deeper connections with family and friends while also facilitating the discovery of new connections and friendships.</p>
            <p className='press__line'>Zecue presents an innovative approach to social media, offering users a captivating and immersive experience akin to a game. By intertwining social networking with gaming elements, Zecue strives to foster meaningful relationships and enhance user engagement on a deeper level. The app aims to differentiate itself from other social media platforms by emphasizing the importance of genuine connections, beyond surface-level interactions.

            <p className='press__line'>However, the harsh reality of battling a social media giant like Instagram has left Zecue in a precarious position. The financial strain caused by repeated rebranding efforts and the looming threat of legal action have undoubtedly hampered the app's growth potential. It raises concerns about the impact on innovation and competition within the social media landscape when smaller players are intimidated by larger corporations.
            </p>
            <p className='press__line'>As the social media landscape continues to evolve, it is crucial for industry leaders to foster an environment of fair competition and support the growth of new entrants. Instagram's aggressive tactics in claiming ownership over the term "reel" have raised eyebrows, prompting discussions about the need for balanced intellectual property protection that encourages innovation without stifling competition.
            </p>
            <p className='press__line'>In the face of adversity, Zecue remains determined to provide users with a unique social media experience that fosters meaningful connections. Time will tell whether Zecue can overcome the hurdles placed before them by Instagram's heavy-handed tactics and establish itself as a platform that empowers its users to connect on a deeper level, free from the specter of legal battles and corporate dominance.
