    Zecue respects the intellectual property rights of others, and we expect you
    to do the same. Zecue’s Terms of Service and Community Guidelines do not
    allow posting, sharing, or sending any content that violates or infringes
    someone else’s copyrights, trademarks or other intellectual property rights.
  </p>
  <p>
    <br />
  </p>
  <h5>Copyright</h5>
  <p>
    Copyright is a legal right that protects original works of authorship (e.g.,
    music, videos, etc.). Generally, copyright protects an original expression
    of an idea (e.g., the specific way a video or music is expressed or created)
    but does not protect underlying ideas or facts.
  </p>
  <p>
    <br />
  </p>
  <h6>Copyright Infringement</h6>
  <p>
    We do not allow any content that infringes copyright. The use of copyrighted
    content of others without proper authorization or legally valid reason may
    lead to a violation of Zecue's policies.
  </p>
  <p>
    <br />
  </p>
  <p>
    At the same time, not all unauthorized uses of copyrighted content
    constitute an infringement. In many countries, exceptions to copyright
    infringement allow the use of copyrighted works under certain circumstances
    without authorization. These include the fair use doctrine in the United
    States and permitted acts of fair dealing in the European Union (and other
    equivalent exceptions under applicable local laws in other countries).
  </p>
  <p>
    <br />
  </p>
  <h6>Removal of Content; Suspension or Termination of Account</h6>
  <p>
    Any user content that infringes another person’s copyright may be removed.
    The account may be suspended or terminated for multiple copyright violations
    in connection with the use of the Zecue site or app, or other violations of
    the Terms of Service and Community Guidelines. We reserve the right to
    refuse any account holder whose account was used for improper activities
    from opening a new account on Zecue’s site or app, or otherwise hosted by
    Zecue.
  </p>
  <p>
    <br />
  </p>
  <h5>Information for Rights Holders:</h5>
  <h6>Copyright Infringement Notification</h6>
  <p>
    Contacting the user directly may resolve your complaint more quickly and in
    a way that is more beneficial to you, the user, and our community. You may
    also file a Copyright Infringement Report to request the removal of the
    alleged infringing content from Zecue.
  </p>
  <p>
    <br />
  </p>
  <p>
    All complaints should contain the information requested in our online
    Copyright Infringement Report form. Failure to include necessary information
    may limit our ability to investigate your claims and may result in your
    complaint being denied.
  </p>
  <p>
    <br />
  </p>
  <p>
    We may provide the account holder with your contact information, including
    the email address and the name of the copyright owner, and/or details of the
    complaint.
  </p>
  <p>
    Before submitting a notification, please be aware that intentionally
    submitting a misleading or fraudulent report may lead to liability for
    damages under section 512(f) of the United States Digital Millennium
    Copyright Act (DMCA) or similar laws as may be applicable in other
    countries.
  </p>
  <p>
    <br />
  </p>
  <p>
    If you submit a report or infringement notification to us, we may contact
    you if we have additional questions about your report or notification.
    Please note that Zecue is not in a position to adjudicate disputes between
    third parties, and may not be able to remove the content or suspend the
    account you reported. As an alternative, you may want to contact the person
    who posted the content or owns the account to try to resolve your issue
    directly.
  </p>
  <p>
    <br />
  </p>
  <h5>Trademark</h5>
  <p>
    A trademark is a word, symbol, slogan, design, or combination of any of the
    foregoing that identifies the source of a product or service and
    distinguishes it from other products or services.
  </p>
  <p>
    <br />
  </p>
  <h6>Trademark Infringement</h6>
  <p>
    Trademark laws prohibit trademark infringement, which is generally the
    unauthorized use of a trademark or service mark in connection with goods or
    services in a way that is likely to cause confusion, deception or mistake
    about the source, origin, sponsorship or affiliation of the associated goods
    and/or services.
  </p>
  <p>
    <br />
  </p>
  <p>
    At the same time, the use of another’s trademark for purposes of accurately
    referencing, lawfully commenting, criticizing, parodying, or reviewing the
    trademark owner’s products or services, or for purposes of comparing them to
    other products or services, where the mark is not used to designate the
    user’s own goods or services or those of a third party, is generally not
    considered a violation of our policies. Likewise, it is generally
    permissible to make a fan page about a brand, even without the brand’s
    permission, provided that you do not claim to speak for or be associated
    with the brand or otherwise violate the brand’s intellectual property
    rights.
  </p>
  <p>
    <br />
  </p>
  <h5>Removal of Content; Suspension or Termination of Account</h5>
  <p>
    Any content that violates another’s trademark rights may be taken down.
    Repeat violations of trademark rights in connection with the use of the
    Zecue site or app, or other violations of the Terms of Service and Community
    Guidelines may result in the suspension or termination of the user account.
    We reserve the right to refuse any account holder whose account was used for
    improper activities from opening a new account on Zecue’s site or app, or
    otherwise hosted by Zecue.
  </p>
  <p>
    <br />
  </p>
  <h5>Trademark Complaint and Notification</h5>
  <p>
    Contacting the user directly may resolve your complaint more quickly and in
    a way that is more beneficial to you, the user, and our community. You may
    also file a Trademark Infringement Report.
  </p>
  <p>
    <br />
  </p>
  <p>
    All complaints should contain the information requested in our online
    Trademark Infringement Report form. Failure to include necessary information
    may limit our ability to deal with your claims and may result in your
    complaint being denied. We may provide the account holder with your contact
    information, including the email address and the name of the trademark
    owner, and/or details of the complaint, in accordance with our Terms of
    Services and Privacy Policy.
  </p>
  <p>
    <br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Before submitting a notification, please be aware that intentionally
    submitting a misleading or fraudulent report may lead to liability for
    damages under laws as may be applicable in some countries.
  </p>
  <p>
    <br />
  </p>
  <h5>Trademark Infringement Counter-Notification</h5>
  <p>
    If you receive a trademark infringement notification that you believe to be
    in error or believe that you are authorized to use the content, you can
    reach out to the trademark owner directly to request a retraction.
  </p>
  <p>
    <br />
  </p>
  <p>
    You may also provide us with a counter-notification via our online Counter
    Notification Form. All counter-notification should contain the information
    requested in our online Counter Notification Form. Failure to include
    necessary information may limit our ability to investigate your claims and
    may result in your counter-notification being denied.
  </p>
  <p>
    <br />
  </p>
  <h5>General Note</h5>
  <p>
    As a Zecue user, you are responsible for the content you post. If you have
    questions about copyright law or trademark law, such as questions about
    whether your content or your use of another person’s name or brand infringes
    or otherwise violates another person’s rights, you may want to contact an
    attorney. If you are unsure whether the material you plan to report to us is
    infringing or otherwise violating another person’s right, you may also want
    to first seek legal advice before reporting such content to us.
